******Three ways of running the program
=>run the actual game from level 1, using default setting(60fps, 200 piexel per second)
make run

=>run the actual game from _level_num, using default setting(60fps, 200 piexel per second)
./a1 _level_num

=>run the actual game from level 1 using customized setting(???fps, ??? piexel per second)
./a1 _frame_rate _speed(piexel per second) 

=>run the actual game from _level_num, using customized setting(???fps,  ??? piexel per second)
./a1 _frame_rate _speed(piexel per second) _level_num

*NOTE: the moving speed you passed in is in the unit(piexel per second)

*******Mechanisms
1. Critical hit: if a ball is caught using the red portion of the paddle, the orb is then super charged, dealing more damage as well as moving faster.

2. Orb enery: If an orb is super charged multiple times, it will split into two orbs.

3. Multiple Stages: passing in number 1-5 to pick your level

4. Multiple Blocks: some blocks dies with 1 hit, some has more hit points indicated by their health color, while some other can ONLY be damaged by a super charged orb.

5. Coner bounce, when the ball comes from the 4 edge points a a block, the ball would bounce straight back

6. Score penalty, the longer you take to clear a leve, the less your score will be.

7. Stable ratio re-sizing: the game will always maintain its correct ratio, and the physics is always done in its original standard coordinate space regardless of the game's current size

8. Opening screen & waiting screen & restart & memory menagment 

9. Iron Blocks crack randomly as they get hit by a super charged orb.

10. Shoot Orb with space button, super smooth left & right keys.
